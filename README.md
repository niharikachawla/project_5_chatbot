Chatbot
A chatbot is an artificial intelligence-powered piece of software in a device (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant etc), application, website or other networks that try to gauge consumer’s needs and then assist them to perform a particular task like a commercial transaction, hotel booking, form submission etc . Today almost every company has a chatbot deployed to engage with the users. Some of the ways in which companies are using chatbots are:

To deliver flight information

to connect customers and their finances

As customer support

The possibilities are (almost) limitless.
I will be using the Wikipedia page for chatbots as our corpus. Copied the contents from the page and placed it in a text file named ‘chatbot.txt’.
It is a very simple bot with hardly any cognitive skills, its a good way to get into NLP and get to know about chatbots
